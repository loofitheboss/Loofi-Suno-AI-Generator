## Project

**Loofi-Suno-AI-Generator** — AI-powered Suno song generator with React frontend and FastAPI backend

Tech stack: TypeScript + React + Vite + FastAPI

## Commands

- Build: `npm run build`

## Code Style

- Strict TypeScript — no implicit `any`, strict null checks
- Named exports only — default exports prohibited
- `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/intersections
- Formatter: prettier — 2-space indent, single quotes, trailing commas
- Linter: eslint — zero warnings in CI
- Path aliases: `@core/`, `@features/`, `@shared/`, `@infrastructure/`, `@/`
- Functional React components only, hooks at top, `ErrorBoundary` wraps panels

## Testing

- Framework: Vitest + @testing-library/react + jsdom
- Test files: co-located as `[name].test.ts(x)`
- Mock external deps with `vi.mock()`

## Commits

Format: `type(scope): description`
Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, ci, perf, revert, style
Scope: kebab-case, max 100 chars subject.
